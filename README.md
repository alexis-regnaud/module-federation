# TypeScript Example

This example demos a basic host/remote application with TypeScript and also streams types.

# Installation

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

# Running Demo

Run `pnpm start`. This will build and serve both `host` and `remote` on ports 3001 and 3002 respectively.

- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/)
